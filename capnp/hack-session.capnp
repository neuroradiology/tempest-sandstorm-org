# This file defines some hacks added on top of the grain session protocol designed to expose some
# basic ways to communicate with the outside world (such as e-mail) without requiring persistent
# capabilities nor the Powerbox (which will take some time to implement). Once the Powerbox is
# available, these hacks should go away. Consider them pre-deprecated.

  getPublicId @0 () -> (publicId :Text, hostname :Text, autoUrl :Text, isDemoUser :Bool);
  # Get the grain's public ID, assigning one if it isn't already assigned. The public ID is used
  # as the e-mail address and for serving static content.
  #
  # If `autoUrl` is non-null, it is an automatically-assigned URL at which the grain's public
  # web content is already visible.
  #
  # If `isDemoUser` is true, the user is a temporary demo account. In this case the app probably
  # should *not* suggest setting up DNS because the grain will disappear soon anyway. (Also our
  # main demo server doesn't support web publishing to arbitrary domains due to sharing an IP
  # address with the alpha server.)
  #
  # Warning: Allocating a public ID means that the /var/www and /var/mail directories become
  #   special. Do not create these directories unless you intend for them to serve their respective
  #   purposes.

  # channels -- i.e. persistent capabilities and Powerbox interactions -- is not implemented.
