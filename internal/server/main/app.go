// uiContentSecurityPolicy returns a content security policy that disallows
// loading of remote resources. It accepts as arguments whether or not we're
// using https, and the root domain name.
//
// Note the following:
//
// - Currently there are still exceptions for images and media, as these have
//   some legitimate use cases (e.g. embedding images in feeds in ttrss) and
//   we want to provide a way for a user to allow these via the UI before we
//   block them by default
// - The unsafe-* directives are currently necessary to avoid breaking many
//   apps. They make CSP not particularly useful in mitating XSS attacks,
//   but do not present an information-leaking hazard.
// - In the future, we should provide a way for apps to opt-in to more
//   restrictive policies, as a useful mitigation for things like XSS vulns.
//   in the apps.
